### 1.1 Game Synopsis

Two rival lizard wizards snuck into a lost city to steal a magic bookâ€”only to be cursed by it.

Now trapped in a time-looping, reality-warping labyrinth, they must work together to fight, puzzle, and portal their way to freedom.

Each run through **The Lost City** and its **Districts of Dawn, Dusk, Midday, and Midnight** offers a randomized path of levels. At every crossroads, your choices define the journeyâ€”**Battlegrounds** that forge your brutality, **Armories** that test your endurance, **Observatories** that challenge your intellect, **Treasuries** that tempt you with riches, and the **Merchant**, who happily trades fortune for firepower.

As you tackle these level types, you shape your runâ€™s evolving identity. Temporary upgrades push your wizards toward distinct strategies, while the treasure you collect fuels powerful buffs at the **Merchantâ€™s Market**.

At the end of each district, a **boss** awaits. If youâ€™ve planned well, your wizard lizards will triumph. If not, the Tomeâ€™s curse takes holdâ€”time snaps back, and your run begins anew.

Victory unlocks the next district permanently and earns you valuable unlock points to invest in permanent character upgrades that reshape future runs. Return to previously-mastered chambers for better loot, new skills, or just to flex your speed-clearing skills.

### 1.3 Core Gameplay Structure

Tomebound is a roguelite built around **two protagonists**.

* In **co-op**, each player controls one character.
* In **single-player**, both are controlled in real-time, with instant character switching.

Each run presents a procedurally generated path through varied level types (combat, platforming, puzzle-solving). Player choices shape the run's direction, allowing them to emphasize their strengths or explore new strategies.

Each **district concludes with a boss fight**, presenting a consistent challenge regardless of the path taken.

### 1.4 Four Design Pillars

Everything designed for *Tomebound* must serve at least one of these four pillars. Anything that doesnâ€™t is out-of-scope.

#### **1. Player-Directed Variety**

> *"The game shapes to the player, not the other way around."*

Players guide the structure of each run by selecting level types. Whether focused on combat, puzzles, platforming, or a mix, every run feels tailored and dynamic.

#### **2. Dual-Character Synergy**

> *"Two lizards, one brainâ€”or two."*

Whether solo or co-op, synergy between the characters is key. Builds, abilities, and tactics are designed to encourage coordination and cooperation.

#### **3. Balanced Challenge Across Disciplines**

> *"Combat tests your reflexes. Puzzles test your reasoning. Platforming tests your control."*

Each skill domain plays a crucial role. Success depends not on specializing in one area, but on building mastery in your chosen route.

#### **4. Modular Progression & Replayability**

> *"Every choice builds toward something lasting."*

Each run grants temporary upgrades and earns unlock points for permanent progression. Failure is part of learning; success opens new paths and possibilities.

### 1.5 Intended Audience
