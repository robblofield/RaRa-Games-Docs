# Tomebound â€“ Game Design Document

## 1. Introduction

**Tomebound** is a co-op (or single-player ðŸ˜¢) *roguelite* for fans of **dungeon crawlers** and **puzzle games** alike.

> **Roguelite** â€“ a game with procedurally generated runs, permadeath, and meta progression via classes, upgrades, or unlocks.
> **Dungeon Crawler** â€“ a game where you explore dungeons, fight enemies, and collect loot.
> **Puzzle Game** â€“ a game where you prove you're smarter than a locked door.

### 1.1 Game Synopsis

Two rival lizard wizards snuck into a lost city to steal a magic bookâ€”only to be cursed by it.

Now trapped in a time-looping, reality-warping labyrinth, they must work together to fight, puzzle, and portal their way to freedom.

Each run through **The Lost City** and its **Districts of Dawn, Dusk, Midday, and Midnight** offers a randomized path of levels. At every crossroads, your choices define the journeyâ€”**Battlegrounds** that forge your brutality, **Gauntlets** that test your endurance, **Observatories** that challenge your intellect, **Treasuries** that tempt you with riches, and the **Merchant**, who happily trades fortune for firepower.

As you tackle these level types, you shape your runâ€™s evolving identity. Temporary upgrades push your wizards toward distinct strategies, while the treasure you collect fuels powerful buffs at the **Merchantâ€™s Market**.

At the end of each district, a **boss** awaits. If youâ€™ve planned well, your wizard lizards will triumph. If not, the Tomeâ€™s curse takes holdâ€”time snaps back, and your run begins anew.

Victory unlocks the next district permanently and earns you valuable unlock points to invest in permanent character upgrades that reshape future runs. Return to previously-mastered chambers for better loot, new skills, or just to flex your speed-clearing skills.

### 1.3 Core Gameplay Structure

Tomebound is a roguelite built around **two protagonists**.

* In **co-op**, each player controls one character.
* In **single-player**, both are controlled in real-time, with instant character switching.

Each run presents a procedurally generated path through varied level types (combat, platforming, puzzle-solving). Player choices shape the run's direction, allowing them to emphasize their strengths or explore new strategies. Upgrades rewarded from the different level types are always single use, meaning you can decide which of the wizard lizards recieves the offered buff - allowing for symetrical/asymetrical builds based on what your solo run or co-op team needs to succeed.

Each **district concludes with a boss fight**, presenting a consistent challenge regardless of the path taken.

---

### 1.4 Four Design Pillars

Everything designed for *Tomebound* must serve at least one of these four pillars. Anything that doesnâ€™t is out-of-scope.

#### **1. Player-Directed Variety**

> *"The game shapes to the player, not the other way around."*

Players guide the structure of each run by selecting level types. Whether focused on combat, puzzles, platforming, or a mix, every run feels tailored and dynamic.

#### **2. Dual-Character Synergy**

> *"Two lizards, one brainâ€”or two."*

Whether solo or co-op, synergy between the characters is key. Builds, abilities, and tactics are designed to encourage coordination and cooperation.

#### **3. Balanced Challenge Across Disciplines**

> *"Combat tests your reflexes. Puzzles test your reasoning. Platforming tests your control."*

Each skill domain plays a crucial role. Success depends not on specializing in one area, but on building mastery in your chosen route.

#### **4. Modular Progression & Replayability**

> *"Every choice builds toward something lasting."*

Each run grants temporary upgrades and earns unlock points for permanent progression. Failure is part of learning; success opens new paths and possibilities.

---

### 1.5 Intended Audience

*Tomebound* is designed for players who enjoy:

* Roguelites with meaningful progression and replayability
* Co-op or single-player experiences with character-driven mechanics
* Games that balance combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving
* Stylized, whimsical, or fantastical worlds with light narrative hooks
* Player agency and adaptable gameplay structure

**Inspirational Titles:** *Hades*, *Portal 2*, *Cult of the Lamb*, *Dead Cells*, *It Takes Two*
Aimed at both casual co-op fans and dedicated roguelite players.

---

## **2.1 â€“ District Progression & Structure**

The game progresses through four districts, each representing a phase of the cursed expedition through **The Lost City**. The districts unfold chronologically, following the lizard wizards' journey from their initial intrusion to their ultimate escape.

---

### **Districts Overview**

* **Midday**
  The starting point. The curse has already taken hold. This district reflects the earliest phase of the expedition, when the city still seems partially intact and its challenges are familiar.

* **Dusk**
  As daylight fades, so does the stability of the world. Enemies grow stranger, puzzles become more abstract, and the environment grows increasingly warped.

* **Midnight**
  The deepest descent. This is the heart of the curseâ€™s powerâ€”an unstable, hostile space of shifting reality and heightened difficulty.

* **Dawn**
  The final challenge. After surviving the night, the lizards push toward escape. The environment lightens, but the trials intensifyâ€”this is the district of resolution and rebirth.

---

### **District Structure**

Each district:

* Contains **procedurally generated paths** of level types:

  * **Plazas** (core progression)
  * Optional detours: **Battlegrounds**, **Gauntlets**, **Observatories**, **Treasuries**, **The Merchant Market**

* Concludes with a **district-specific boss encounter**

* Becomes **permanently unlocked** once completed

* Grants **unlock points** used for meta-progression and expanding future build options

---

## 2.2 Gameplay Breakdown

### 2.2.1 Combat

Combat in *Tomebound* emphasizes **movement**, **spacing**, and **reactive timing**. Attacks are **deliberately paced**, rewarding precision and commitment over button-mashing. Encounters are often **wave-based**, requiring players to manage enemies, terrain, and each otherâ€™s positioning.

---

#### Core Moveset

* **Three-Hit Melee Combo**

  * Light chaining with generous timing
  * Progressive base damage increase
  * Final hit has increased damage and knockback but slower recovery

* **Dash / Dodge Roll** *(Omni-directional)*

  * Grants invulnerability during off-the-ground frames
  * Used for spacing, repositioning, or disengaging

* **Dash Attack** *(High-impact movement attack)*

  * Single hit with high base damage
  * Chance to critically strike
  * Long recovery time

* **Jump Attack** *(Vertical slam)*

  * Single hit with chance to stun
  * Useful for initiating or disrupting enemies
  * Long recovery time

---

#### Battleground Example

> **Scenario:** Enter an enclosed arena.

* Enemies spawn in escalating waves
* **Survive for 60 seconds** to unlock exit *(Basic reward)*
* **Stay longer** to earn better rewards:

  * **Rare:** 90 seconds
  * **Epic:** 200 seconds

---

#### Example Brutality Upgrades

* Increased crit chance
* Increased stun chance
* Area of Effect (AoE) radius
* Lingering damage effects (burn, poison, etc.)
* Faster attack and recovery speed

---

#### Reward Tier Examples

| **Tier**  | **Stat Boosts**                                    | **Notes**                                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic** | +2â€“3% to stats (damage, crit rate, AoE size, etc.) | â€”                                                                                                              |
| **Rare**  | +7â€“10% to stats                                    | â€”                                                                                                              |
| **Epic**  | +15â€“20% or Ã—2.5 on stat                            | Includes a temporary **+10% boost** for next 5 encounters â€” great risk/reward if you're about to face the boss |

---


## **2.2.2 â€“ Platforming & Traversal**

Platforming in *Tomebound* emphasizes **timing, spatial awareness, and recovery under pressure**. These sequences are designed to add tension, reward clean movement, and create visual rhythm between combat and puzzle segments. Players must navigate hazards, moving terrain, and traversal puzzles while under light time pressure.

While the game uses a **3D isometric perspective**, movement is tightly controlled in **2D space**, with stylized animations supporting clarity over hyper-realistic motion.

---

### **Core Movement Mechanics**

* **Run / Walk**
  Base movement with tuned acceleration and deceleration. Momentum allows for short sprints and intentional directional shifts.

* **Jump**
  Standard arc with variable height based on press duration. Used for clearing gaps, navigating hazards, and chaining through vertical layouts.

* **Wall Climb (Vines, Ladders, Surfaces)**
  Certain surfaces are climbable, allowing vertical traversal and alternate paths. No ledge-grabbing or auto-clambering; movement remains clean and stylized.

* **Dodge Roll (Aerial)**
  Dodge roll can be triggered midair to **cancel fall damage** or **recover momentum**, rewarding clutch reflexes and route awareness. Also useful for slipping past traps or reorienting during jumps.

---

### **Gauntlet Gameplay Example**

**Gauntlets** are traversal-focused challenge levels that test the playerâ€™s ability to move through hazardous environments efficiently.

* Enter a timed gauntlet featuring environmental hazards such as spike traps, moving platforms, collapsing floors, and other traversal challenges.
* Complete the course to unlock the exit.
* **Faster completion times** grant better rewards, encouraging mastery and precision.

| Time to Complete  | Reward Tier |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Under 200 seconds | **Basic**   |
| Under 120 seconds | **Rare**    |
| Under 60 seconds  | **Epic**    |

> *Note: Final timing thresholds may vary slightly depending on level layout and difficulty tuning.*

---

### **Example Survivalist Upgrades**

Survivalist upgrades improve a characterâ€™s **resilience and recovery**, helping them survive longer in high-pressure situations.

* Increased **maximum health**
* Increased **defense / damage resistance**
* Chance to **auto-block** one incoming hit every few seconds
* **Movement speed** boost
* **Dodge roll cooldown** reduced

---

### **Reward Tier Effects**

| Tier  | Stat Boost Example                    | Bonus Effect (Epic only)                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Basic | +2â€“3% to health, defense, speed, etc. | â€”                                              |
| Rare  | +7â€“10% stat increase                  | â€”                                              |
| Epic  | +15â€“20% or **x2.5 multiplier**        | Temporary **+2 HP/sec regen** for next 5 rooms |

Epic-tier upgrades provide a **short-term regen bonus** to support recovery between encountersâ€”especially valuable before boss fights or extended traversal sections.

---

Absolutely! Here's the **final, full version of 2.2.3 â€“ Puzzle Gameplay**, fully updated with all your changes and formatted to match the previous sections:

---

## **2.2.3 â€“ Puzzle Gameplay**

Puzzle encounters in *Tomebound* emphasize **observation, logic, and teamwork**. These segments provide structured cerebral challenges that require input and coordination from **both lizard wizards**â€”whether in co-op or single-player switching.

**All puzzles require two-character interaction**, through timing, positioning, or sequencing. Even basic mechanics like pressure plates or rune inputs demand cooperation and strategic thinking.

Outside of the regular Runegate that must be completed in every Plaza; other puzzles occasionally appear within **Plazas** to reveal interesting lore elements or collectibles. However, only puzzles encountered in **Observatories** award Intellect-based upgrades. These rooms are focused entirely on **mechanical mastery** and do not contain lore or narrative elements.

---

### **Core Puzzle Interaction Mechanics**

* **Rune Discovery and Sequencing**
  Uncover hidden glyphs throughout the environment and activate them in the correct order to open Runegates or unlock exits.

* **Pattern Recognition**
  Identify matching symbols, repeating paths, or environmental tells to complete ancient mechanisms.

* **Pressure Plates & Weighted Switches**
  Require both characters to act in tandemâ€”either simultaneously or in a specific sequenceâ€”to unlock doors, reveal new puzzle elements, or shift room states.

* **Circuit Puzzles / Magical Flow**
  Redirect magical energy through rotating sigils, beam reflectors, or arcane nodesâ€”often requiring coordination to align paths correctly.

* **Logic Problems**
  Simple tasks layered with constraints (e.g., only one character can move at a time, objects must be kept separate), turning them into multi-step puzzles.

* **Deduction Challenges**
  Classic reasoning puzzles, such as "one door leads to death, the other to escape," requiring players to extract truth from environmental clues or contradictory rules.

---

### **Observatory Gameplay Example**

> **Scenario:** Enter a sealed puzzle chamber with no enemies.

The room presents a logic- or coordination-based puzzle that must be solved through experimentation, planning, and collaboration.

**Performance is judged by efficiency**, not speed. Each puzzle room includes a **reset mechanism**. Using it restarts the chamber and clears all progress - useful for recovery, but it reduces your reward tier. Mistakes (e.g., false glyphs, incorrect switches, broken sequences) are also tracked.

---

#### **Performance-Based Reward Tiers**

| Criteria                                                | Reward Tier |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Solved with **no mistakes** and **no resets**           | **Epic**    |
| Solved with **1 reset**, or with minor incorrect inputs | **Rare**    |
| Solved with **2+ resets** or frequent errors            | **Basic**   |

---

#### **Failure / Exit Option**

Observatories are unique in that they **do not block progression**. If a player is unable to solve the puzzle, they may choose to:

* **Give Up and Exit the Room** â€“ Continue the run, but receive a **temporary negative effect** for the next 5 encounters.
* **Abandon the Run** â€“ Return to the hub and restart.

This ensures that puzzles never halt progression, while still attaching meaningful risk to failure.

---

### **Example Intellect Upgrades**

Intellect upgrades reward smart play with **utility, stealth, and economy-breaking potential**. Theyâ€™re designed for players who exploit the environment, avoid danger, and seek hidden rewards.

* **Sneak Rating Increase** â€“ Reduces detection chance in stealth-sensitive areas.
* **Evasion Boost** â€“ Grants a chance to passively dodge incoming damage.
* **Luck Boost** â€“ Traps triggered by the player have a chance to misfire or fail.
* **Barter Bonus** â€“ Shop prices decrease, or trade-in values improve.
* **Thief Bonus** - Additional Treasure is recovered from opened chests
* **Plaza-Specific Intuition (Epic only)** â€“ Detects **Treasure Troves** and rare **Shifting Runes**:

  * **Treasure Troves** â€“ Hidden caches of currency and items.
  * **Shifting Rune** â€“ Can serve as a wildcard solution in any rune position, reducing combination complexity.

---

### **Reward Tier Effects**

| Tier  | Stat Boost Example                         | Bonus Effect (Epic only)                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic | +2â€“3% to sneak, evasion, luck, or barter   | â€”                                                                                                           |
| Rare  | +7â€“10% boost to utility stats              | â€”                                                                                                           |
| Epic  | +15â€“20% or **x2.5 multiplier** to one stat | Temporary **Treasure Sense**: reveals hidden troves and chance to find a **Shifting Rune** in next 5 Plazas |
